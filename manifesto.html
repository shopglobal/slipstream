<h1>Slipstream Manifesto</h1>

<p>We believe there is a way to curate the best content on the web and provide a delightful experience to consume and discover that content.</p>
 
<p>Slipstream aims to accomplish this feat for three main content types: articles, videos, and music.</p>
 
<p>First, Slipstream is a place for you to save and organize all your favorite content from the web quickly and easily, then provide a delightful experience to locate and consume that content later. The second major component of Slipstream is a discovery engine. As Slipstream becomes the preferred place for people to save their favorite content, it also needs to do a brilliant job of surfacing the best of this content according to a user's individual tastes. If we succeed at this, we believe Slipstream will provide a ton of utlity while also being a joy to use.</p>
 
<p>The frustration we faced and why we needed to build Slipstream is obviously something we hope many people can understand and possibly relate to. Social networks are frequently used as a place to save amazing content into one's feed, but this was not part of the feature set these products were originally built for. They were designed to connect people with other people (friends, family, celebrities and organizations), not to connect people with content from the web. Their features revolved around sharing photos and stories with a network of close personal contacts or fans/followers. Over time, they have tried to cater to many new use-cases, however, without seriously jeopardizing their original purpose they can't possibly provide the best experience for any other use-case. Crucially, the people you’ve connected with for social relationships are not necessarily the same people you would connect with to curate and exchange quality web content. In fact, most users (including us) only saved certain content to social feeds for lack of a better option.</p>
 
<p>Meanwhile, there is a ton of human content curation happening that is not being properly leveraged.</p>
 
<p>There is a way to do this correctly. And we've been focusing on just that.</p>
 
<p>The community will be a huge factor in delivering on Slipstream's promise. The content you curate and save to Slipstream will determine the quality of content that circulates the network. Ultimately, as a community, what we put into Slipstream is what we will get out of it.</p>
 
<p>With that in mind, on Slipstream you will encounter new ways to keep users focused on quality. We don’t think the number of followers you have should be important, or the number of posts you make or comments those posts generate. These are all just distractions to encourage engagement on a platform and we're going to leave all that to the social networks. Success as a user on Slipstream will be based on the utility you can derive from the platform for yourself. In turn, that will mean the community is benefitting as a whole.</p>
 
<p>If you focus on posting what expands your mind, peeks your interest to the highest degree, inspires you and makes you feel amazing, then the likelihood of your contribution having the same effect on someone else is quite high.</p>
 
<p>We think this can change the curation space for the better.</p>
 
<p>And we’re really looking forward to it.</p>
